# Eligible Club Groups Feature

## Overview
This feature allows recorders to create and manage groups of clubs that will be eligible to participate in specific events (Yearly Club Championships or Club Competitions).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **New Utility Functions** (`utility_function/event_utility.py`)

#### `get_all_clubs()`
- Fetches all clubs from the database
- Returns list of clubs with their IDs and names

#### `create_eligible_group_with_clubs(club_ids)`
- Creates a new eligible group in the `eligible_group_of_club` table
- Adds specified clubs to the group via `eligible_club_member` table
- Returns the newly created `eligible_group_id`
- Includes rollback on failure

#### `get_eligible_group_details(eligible_group_id)`
- Retrieves details of a specific eligible group
- Returns group ID and list of member clubs with their details

#### `get_all_eligible_groups()`
- Fetches all eligible groups from the database
- Includes member club details for each group
- Returns list of groups with their clubs

### 2. **New Tab for Recorders** (Pages/Event.py)

Added a new **"üè¢ Club Groups"** tab with two sub-tabs:

#### **Create Club Group Tab**
- Lists all available clubs in the database
- Multi-select interface to choose clubs
- Preview of selected clubs before creation
- Creates the eligible group with one click
- Displays the new group ID for use in event creation

#### **View Existing Groups Tab**
- Displays all existing eligible club groups
- Shows group ID and member count
- Expandable sections for each group showing:
  - Group ID
  - Number of member clubs
  - Table of all member clubs
  - Usage instructions
- Refresh button to reload groups

### 3. **Enhanced Event Creation Wizard**

Updated the event creation wizard (Step 2: Basic Information) for both event types:

#### **Previous Implementation**
- Simple text input for "Eligible Group ID"
- User had to manually type the group ID
- No preview of which clubs are in the group

#### **New Implementation**
- Dropdown selector with all available eligible groups
- Option to select "All Clubs (No Restriction)"
- Shows descriptive labels: "Group {ID} ({X} clubs)"
- Preview panel that expands to show all member clubs
- Automatic handling when no groups exist

### 4. **Updated Imports**
Added necessary imports to Event.py:
```python
from utility_function.event_utility import (
    ...,
    get_all_clubs,
    create_eligible_group_with_clubs,
    get_eligible_group_details,
    get_all_eligible_groups
)
```
