# Score Tracking & Performance Pages - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully created two comprehensive pages for your Archery Management Application:
1. **Score Tracking Page** - For recording and managing archer scores

## Key Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ User-Friendly Search
- **All searches use names, not IDs!**
- Archers select by name: "John Doe (ID: 7)"
- Competitions select by name: "Summer Open Tournament (ID: 1)"
- Rounds select by name: "Olympic Round - Adult Recurve (ID: 1)"
- System handles ID conversion automatically

### ‚úÖ Data Visualization
- Gauge charts for percentiles and performance
- Bar charts for leaderboards
- Color-coded indicators (green for good, gold for elite)
- Interactive Plotly charts

### ‚úÖ Role-Based Access
- Archers: Add, view, manage own scores + performance analytics
- Recorders: Verify scores, view all scores for assigned competitions
- Proper authorization checks

### ‚úÖ Smart Validation
- Can only modify unverified scores
- Recorders can only verify competitions they're assigned to
- Score ranges validated (0-10 per arrow)
- Real-time total calculation

### ‚úÖ Performance Metrics
1. **Round Performance**: Total score, ranking, percentile for specific round/competition
2. **Normalized Average**: Average score efficiency across championship competitions
3. **Category Rating**: Global percentile ranking by category
4. **Personal Statistics**: Overall performance metrics and trends
5. **Community Leaderboard**: Compare against other participants

## Database Integration
- Uses Supabase PostgREST API
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Status tracking (pending ‚Üí eligible/ineligible)
- Type tracking (competition vs practice)
- Arrow-by-arrow score recording

## Formula Implementation
‚úÖ **Normalized Score Formula** (as per requirements):
```
A = B/C
where:
B = actual score attained
C = max score (number of arrows * 10)
Example: 180/360 = 0.5
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add score trend charts over time
2. Export performance reports to PDF
3. Add score prediction/projections
4. Implement practice recommendations based on performance
5. Add team/club aggregate performance views
6. Email notifications when scores are verified

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create test scores as an archer
2. Verify scores as a recorder
3. View performance analytics
4. Check leaderboards
5. Test with multiple categories
6. Verify authorization (try accessing other users' data)

## Notes
- All user-facing selections use descriptive names with IDs in parentheses
- The system automatically handles name‚ÜíID conversion
- Error handling included for database failures
- Empty states handled gracefully with helpful messages
- Visual feedback with colors, icons, and charts
